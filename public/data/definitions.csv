Lead is a multi-organ system toxicant that can cause neurological, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, haematological and reproductive effects. It is accumulated in bone and may serve as a source of exposure later in life. There is presently no known threshold for the effect of lead. Children are especially vulnerable and lead exposure can lower their IQ. Lead is known to bioaccumulate in terrestrial and aquatic environments.
