It is dense, malleable, readily fusible, and has a low melting point. Lead exists as metallic lead, inorganic lead compounds and organic lead compounds. Lead is a multi-organ system toxicant that can cause neurological, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, haematological and reproductive effects. It is accumulated in bone and may serve as a source of exposure later in life. There is presently no known threshold for the effect of lead. Children are especially vulnerable and lead exposure can lower their IQ. Lead is known to bioaccumulate in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Lead-acid battery is the major use of lead, accounting for 78 % of reported global consumption in 2003. Other major application areas are lead compounds, lead sheets, ammunition, and cable sheathing.

Other uses include: lubricants, fluorescent light ballasts, paints, glues, waxes, carbonless copy paper, inks including newspapers, dust-control agents for dirt roads, solvents for spreading insecticides, and cutting oils. PCBs are stable compounds and although they are no longer manufactured, they are extremely persistent and remain in huge quantities in the atmosphere and in landfill sites. They are not water-soluble and float on the surface of water where they are enter the food chain. PCBs are fat-soluble, and are therefore easy to take into the system, but difficult to excrete.

Desertification affects the lives of three-quarters of the world's population, 70% of all drylands and one quarter of the total land area of the planet. There are many reasons for desertification, but the majority are caused by human activities, overgrazing, deforestation, poor land management and over-exploitation.

It comprises direct glare, chronically increased illumination and temporary, unexpected fluctuations in lighting. The sources of ecological light pollution include sky glow, illuminated buildings, streetlights, fishing boats, security lights, lights on vehicles, flares on offshore oil platforms, and even lights on undersea research vessels. Harmful effects involve the animal kingdom, the vegetable kingdom and mankind. While light pollution is eminently detrimental to nocturnal and migratory animals and to animals in flight, it also produces harmful effects on plants. (Source: LONGCORE, T., RICH, C. 2004.
